// This is a placeholder for the new animated GIF file
// It should show the app in action, with animations and transitions
// between different screens and features.

// The exact content of the GIF is not specified, but it should be
// visually appealing and demonstrate the app's functionality.

// For example, it could show:
// - The app's launcher icon and the initial splash screen
// - Navigation between different tabs or sections
// - Interactions with specific features, such as the suggestion library
//   or the heart rate monitor
// - Animations and transitions between different screens
// - Examples of how the app can be used in different scenarios

// The GIF should be looping, so it repeats indefinitely when played.
